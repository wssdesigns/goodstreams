          <p>Our two goals are to help you</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep a watchlist of the movies and shows you plan to watch so you don't find yourself spending more time researching than watching.</li>
            <li>Get ideas for what to watch next from your network of friends and family.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We've found the best ideas for what to watch come from recommendations from people you trust instead of ratings. We hope GoodStreams helps you to spend less time aimlessly browsing platforms that use advanced algorithms optimized to keep you glued to their services.</p>
